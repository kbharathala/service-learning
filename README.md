Service Learning Website

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

This repository contains the basic framework for a website which logs community service hours. Uses MySQL to store users/passwords
and uses JavaScript and PHP for the web framework.

Further things to implement:
1) BackEnd Access for admin to approve student hours.
2) Better integration with current system at Mission San Jose High School
3) Redo in Django / Flask / Node??
